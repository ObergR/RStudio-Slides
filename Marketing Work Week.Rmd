# High Leverage Strategy Recap

.large[
- Build free and open source R tools that get rave reviews from end users and create self-sustaining support community (displaces traditional enterprise software sales, outbound marketing & support expenses.)
- Create commercial upgrades and complementary products with compelling value
- Price appropriate to incremental value and relative to entrenched analytic tools.
- Build 3rd party training & consulting ecosystem (stay focused on software)
Optimize for inbound go-to-market with mix of direct sales (new and expand renewals), OEM / VAR, and referral partners and agents.
